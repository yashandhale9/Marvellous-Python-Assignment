## 📘 About the Assignment

This folder contains solutions for **Python Assignment 7** from  
**Marvellous Infosystems – Python Automation & Machine Learning** course conducted by **Piyush Khairnar Sir**.  

This assignment focuses on **lambda functions** and **functional programming concepts** using `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.  
The exercises strengthen your understanding of:
- 🧩 Anonymous (lambda) functions  
- 🔁 Functional operations (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)  
- 🧮 List processing and iteration  
- 🔤 String handling and palindrome checking  
- 🔢 Prime number logic using functional tools  

Each problem is implemented in a **separate `.py` file** with proper function definitions and clean structure.

## 🧩 Problem Statements

### 1️⃣ Program 1 – Square and Cube using Lambda
Write two lambda functions:  
- One to calculate **square** of a number  
- Another to calculate **cube** of a number  

**Example:**

Input: 3  
Output:  
Square: 9  
Cube: 27  

---

### 2️⃣ Program 2 – Double Values using map()
Accept a list of integers from the user and use `map()` to **double each value**.

**Example:**

Input: 1 2 3 4 5  
Output: Doubled list: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

---

### 3️⃣ Program 3 – Filter Even Numbers
Accept a list of numbers and use `filter()` to **keep only even numbers**.

**Example:**

Input: 1 2 3 4 5 6  
Output: Even numbers: [2, 4, 6]

---

### 4️⃣ Program 4 – Product of Numbers using reduce()
Accept a list of numbers and use `reduce()` (from `functools`) to find the **product of all numbers**.

**Example:**

Input: 2 3 4  
Output: Product: 24

---

### 5️⃣ Program 5 – Palindrome Check
Write a function that accepts a string and checks whether it is a **palindrome**.

**Example:**

Input: radar  
Output: radar is a palindrome.

---

### 6️⃣ Program 6 – Prime Numbers using filter()
Accept a list of integers and return a list of **prime numbers** using `filter()`.

**Example:**

Input: 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17  
Output: Prime numbers: [11, 13, 17]

---

**📝 Notes:**

Use Python 3.x or later  
Each program is written using lambda and functional tools  
Import `functools` where required for `reduce()`  

---

**🎯 Learning Outcomes**

- Learned to define and use **lambda functions**  
- Practiced applying **map()**, **filter()**, and **reduce()** effectively  
- Gained hands-on experience with **functional style programming**  
- Understood filtering and transformation operations on lists  
- Strengthened logic for **palindrome** and **prime number detection**
