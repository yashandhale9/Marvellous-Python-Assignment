## 📘 About the Assignment

This folder contains solutions for **Python Assignment 6** from  
**Marvellous Infosystems – Python Automation & Machine Learning** course conducted by **Piyush Khairnar Sir**.  

This assignment focuses on **looping constructs and iterative logic** in Python.  
The programs are designed to strengthen your understanding of:
- 🔁 `for` and `while` loops  
- 🧮 Mathematical computation using iterations  
- 🧩 Nested loops for pattern generation  
- 🔢 Logical decision-making using loops  

Each problem is implemented in a **separate `.py` file**, following a clean, modular, and easy-to-read structure.

## 🧩 Problem Statements

### 1️⃣ Program 1 – Numbers from 1 to 50
Write a Python program using a **while loop** to print numbers from 1 to 50.

**Expected Output:**
1 2 3 4 5 ... 50


---

### 2️⃣ Program 2 – Sum of Even Numbers (1–100)
Write a Python program to find and print the **sum of all even numbers** between 1 and 100.

**Expected Output:**
Sum of even numbers between 1 to 100 is: 2550


---

### 3️⃣ Program 3 – Multiplication Table
Accept a number from the user and print its **multiplication table** up to 10.

**Example:**

Input: 7

Output:
7 x 1 = 7
7 x 2 = 14
...
7 x 10 = 70


---

### 4️⃣ Program 4 – Factorial of a Number
Accept a number from the user and print its **factorial** using a `for` loop.

**Example:**

Input: 5

Output: Factorial of 5 is: 120


---

### 5️⃣ Program 5 – Prime Number Check
Accept a number from the user and check whether it is **prime** or **not**.

**Example:**

Input: 11

Output: 11 is a prime number.


---

### 6️⃣ Program 6 – Triangle Star Pattern
Write a Python program to print a **right-angled triangle star pattern** using nested loops.



---

### 7️⃣ Program 7 – Largest Among Five Numbers
Accept **five numbers** from the user and print the **largest number** among them.

**Example:**

Input: 23 89 12 56 45

Output: Maximum number is: 89

---


**📝 Notes:**

Use Python 3.x or later

Each file runs independently

Proper loop logic and indentation are essential

----

**🎯 Learning Outcomes**

Strengthened understanding of loops and iteration in Python

Learned to implement for and while loops effectively

Practiced pattern printing and iterative calculations

Improved control flow and logic-building using nested loops
