## 📘 About the Assignment

This folder contains solutions for **Python Assignment 2** from  
**Marvellous Infosystems – Python Automation & Machine Learning** course conducted by **Piyush Khairnar Sir**.  

This assignment focuses on **modular programming**, **loops**, and **pattern printing** in Python.  
The exercises strengthen your understanding of:
- 🧩 Creating and importing modules  
- 🔁 Using nested loops  
- 🧮 Performing mathematical computations  
- 🧠 Logic building and code reusability  

Each question is solved in an **independent `.py` file**, following proper naming and function-based structure.

## 🧩 Problem Statements

### 1️⃣ Program 1 – Arithmetic Module
Create a module named **`Arithmetic`** containing four functions:
- `Add(a, b)` – returns addition  
- `Sub(a, b)` – returns subtraction  
- `Mult(a, b)` – returns multiplication  
- `Div(a, b)` – returns division  

Write a program to **import this module** and call all functions by taking two numbers from the user.
