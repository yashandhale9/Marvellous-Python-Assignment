## 📘 About the Assignment

This folder contains solutions for **Python Assignment 11** from  
**Marvellous Infosystems – Python Automation & Machine Learning** course conducted by **Piyush Khairnar Sir**.  

This assignment focuses on **recursion concepts in Python**.  
You’ll practice writing programs that solve problems by **calling themselves recursively**.  
The exercises are designed to strengthen your logic building and understanding of:
- 🔁 Recursive function design  
- 🧩 Base and recursive cases  
- 🧮 Mathematical recursion (factorial, power, sum)  
- 🔢 Number and pattern problems solved recursively  

Each program is implemented in an independent `.py` file, using clear recursion logic.
